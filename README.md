# FRR_ML_Optimization
This code is to 1) predict the fire resistance rating (FRR) of wood-steel-wood (WSW) connections based on machine-learning (ML) models and 2) optimize the FRR of the connection using Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA=II).

140 test and modelling results are collected and performances of nine ML models on the dataset are evaluated.
